# Challenge Name:   challenge1.sh
# Student Task:     Fix the fundamental error in this script.
# Description:      Shell scripts need specific formatting to run correctly.
#                   Identify and correct the issue preventing this script
#                   from executing as intended.
# Script Purpose:   This script is intended to print a simple string "Hello, world!"
#                   to the standard output.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem:          The script fails to execute or produces an error because
#                   it's not being interpreted by the correct program.
#
# Expected Output:  When executed correctly (e.g., ./challenge1.sh), the
#                   script should print exactly:
#
#                   Hello, world!
#
# Hint:             Look up the term "shebang" in the context of Linux shell
#                   scripts.
#
# Testing:          After making the required modification, make the script
#                   executable (`chmod +x challenge1.sh`) and run it
#                   (`./challenge1.sh`). Verify the output matches the
#                   "Expected Output" above.

# --- Script Code ---
# The command below is correct and should not be changed.
# The problem lies in how the script itself is being started.

echo "Hello, world!"

#--- End of Script ---
